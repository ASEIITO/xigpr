# XiGPR index
This repository offers an geopolitical risk (GPR) dataset derived from textual data related to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In our paper (Ito, Lim, and Zhang 2025), we developed a Xi Jinping's GPR index (XiGPR). This index is constructed using a text dataset comprising speeches and reports by the Chinese President from March 2013 to December 2024.

## Background
 Led by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022), the GPR index have been widely used by academics as well as financial institutions (see [the GPR website](https://www.matteoiacoviello.com/gpr.htm)) 
 
 
## Our method and interpretation
Following Caldara and Iacoviello (2022), we employed a dictionary method by using Chinese keywords. For more details, please see Ito, Lim, and Zhang (2025).
